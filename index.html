                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. He was a lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.</p>
                <p>Gandhi spent over 20 years in South Africa, where he developed his concept of <strong>Satyagraha</strong> (truth-force), a method of peaceful resistance that he would later employ to challenge British rule in India.</p>
